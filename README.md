# Sierpinski Triangle with Turtle Graphics

This Python script generates a Sierpinski triangle using the Turtle graphics library. The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal structure formed by recursively dividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles.

## Instructions

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the Turtle graphics library if it's not already installed. You can typically install it via pip:

     ```bash
     pip install PythonTurtle
     ```

2. **Running the Script:**
   - Save the provided Python script (`sierpinski_triangle.py`) in your desired directory.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
   - Run the script by executing the following command:

     ```bash
     python sierpinski_triangle.py
     ```

3. **Customization:**
   - You can modify the `order` and `size` parameters in the `main()` function to adjust the level of recursion and the size of the Sierpinski triangle.
   - The `order` parameter determines the level of recursion (higher values result in more intricate patterns).
   - The `size` parameter determines the size of the initial equilateral triangle.

4. **Output:**
   - The script will draw the Sierpinski triangle pattern using Turtle graphics.
   - A window will pop up displaying the generated pattern.
   - The background color is set to black, and the pen color is set to white by default. You can customize these colors within the script if desired.

5. **Termination:**
   - Once the pattern is drawn, you can close the window to terminate the program.

## Example
